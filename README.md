# 1-Introduction
This is a project to predict the price of laptops based on their specs. In this project, the following steps were done:
- Loading data
- Data Cleaning & Pre-Processing
- EDA
- Machine learning Model creation
- Voting & Bagging regressors
- XGBoost to increase efficiency
- Cross-validation, Hyperparameter Tuning
- Streamlit app for end users to put their specs & predict the price
# 2-Methods
### 2.1. Data
The dataset used is the [Laptop Prices dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohidabdulrehman/laptop-price-dataset) from Kaggle. The data

### 2.1 Data Cleaning & Pre-Processing
#### Splitting columns using Regular Expression
#### Handling Missing values 
#### Handling datatypes

### 2.2 EDA
#### Univariate Data Analysis
#### Bi & Multivariate data analysis 
#### Showing what feature has the highest effect on Laptop price

### 2.3 Machine learning
##### Comparing different Regression Models
##### Applying Votting & Bagging Regressors
##### Cross-validation & HyperPrameter Tuning
##### Using XGBoost to increase accuracy to 92%

### 2.4 Streamlit Model
##### Created a webpage app for end user to easily predict the price
